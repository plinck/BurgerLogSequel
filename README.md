# Burger Log - Node Express Handlebars / Sequelize / Google Cloud Platform

## Overview

![Burger Log](public/assets/img/BurgerLog275x200.png)

This application is a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It uses the MVC design pattern, Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.  I also use some client side renderring per the advice of an instructor (Sterling) to deal with Modal Dialog boxes and quick changes to HTML.

### Note

I deployed to **Google Cloud Platform** (not Heroku) since I already reached my limit on Heroku apps.  I have outlined the steps for deploying app and DB to GCP.  It is much more involved than Heroku but provides some benefits in access and scale.

### Design

* Burger Log is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a mySQL database, whether devoured or not.
  
* The user can also delete a devoured burger by clicking the delete (X) icon to the right of devoured burger.

* I used ES6 classes for all the classes/objects (e.g. Orm, Connection etc)

* Follows Model View Controller (MVC) pattern
